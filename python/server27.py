# SERVER
"""
The Server offers its possible services by dislaying a menu with options.
The options can be selected by a client. Some options only require the
code, which is always a 5-letter string (i.e copyf for copying a file).
Other options also require more details, so the main loop of serve_requests
analyzes it, and extracts the right information.
Some data is kept in pre-determined files. Appropriate messages display on
the screen for success or failure with fullfiling the client's requests.
