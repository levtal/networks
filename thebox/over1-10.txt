Bandit Level 0
Level Goal
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which
 you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. 
 The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0.
  

user = bandit0
run(from command line):
ssh -l bandit0 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
  (password = bandit0 )     

once login   'ls' showes one file:  readme
the password written  in this file is: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1  

1 →  2 
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
exit
run:  ssh -l bandit1 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   (user = bandit1) 
   (password = boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1 )
   ls result is one file named: '-'
   run: cat ./-
      You must add ./ because, when cat sees the string – as a filename, it treats it as a synonym for 
	  stdin, so it won't open the file.

   ls result is one file, named: 'spaces in this filename'
