Connection should be performed by command line.
 Browse to the folder you extracted the files and type 
 openvpn zamberg.ovpn.

Attention: IPv6 support is required for the vpn to work. Also, in some OSes, the command prompt must be run as Administrator/root otherwise the connection will complete but it will fail to install the required routes to communicate with the machines.
Alternative TCP Connection

In case your firewall/country is restrictive and does not allow UDP/1337, by changing the following two lines in your .ovpn file you can connect using TCP/443
proto udp > proto tcp
remote <server>.hackthebox.eu 1337 > remote <server>.hackthebox.eu 443
