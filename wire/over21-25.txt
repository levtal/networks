Level 20 â†’ Level 21 
	 
 ssh -l bandit20 bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
 password = GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
  
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following:
 it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as 
 a commandline argument. 
 It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the 
 password in the previous level (bandit20). 
 If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next 
 level (bandit21).
